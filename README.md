# Mechanical_RobotArm_Task1
1’st Main Task in Mechanical department.  

**Design a 3D Robotic Arm on Cinema 4D:**  
1-I Download Cinema 4D from this website “https://www.maxon.net/en/downloads/” 

2-Then Download the arm packages from S-M GitHub  

3-Opened .STL files on Cinema 4D 
 

**Installation instructions:**
 
1-First, put the robot base on a stable surface or on the ground.  

2-Second, Attach the first Servo motor from underneath the base and make sure you attach the needed nails and screw tightly and gently.  

3-Attach the waist of the robot arm to the base and attach the nails until it’s stable. 

4-Attach the second motor to the waist where you are going to find a specific square spot to put it inside. Make sure not to forget the nails or any needed wires. 

5-On the opposite side of the motor, you should attach the first arm into it.  

6-Take the first robot arm, it’s the one that doesn’t have a rectangle space for any motors and contains a small hook at the end of it. 

7-Place the arm in a straight position, make sure to place the flat side of the arm near to the Servo motor and attached to it directly, and the other bent side to the is faced outside. 

8-To make sure the first arm is on the right end, check if the hook is on the bottom nearest to the waist.  

9-After that, attach the second arm to the first arm and attach its third & fourth Servo motor + nails & wires.  

10-Now, hold the end effector “the gripper” to the top second arm  

11-The gripper contains a stand on the bottom where it has holes for the nails to attach it to the arm.  

12-Place the gripper on the opposite side of the motor. 

13-Make sure this stand or attachment piece is on the closest of the gripper and the rest of the gripper faces the outside, so basically the body of the gripper is not directly above the arm “to allow the movement”.  

14-Lastly, attach the fifth motor to the gripper and make sure you didn’t forget any needed nails or wires
